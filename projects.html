                <h3>Open Sauce 2024</h3>
                <p>Open Sauce was an exciting exhibitor showcase where I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from makers around the world. I participated in insightful discussions, observed key figures in the industry sharing their journeys, and learned about the challenges faced in both media creation and technical development. During the exhibition, I presented several of my recent projects, including the aWear Cardiac Monitor, The Feedback Loop homeostasis device, and AGGRO, among others. It was an invaluable experience for connecting with innovators and exchanging feedback.</p>

                <p>Associated with University of Minnesota</p>
                <p>The Feedback Loop is an educational tool that gamifies the body’s homeostasis processes, making biology interactive and engaging. Through both software and hardware, the device demonstrates various feedback systems in the body, such as temperature regulation (thermostat knob) and PID loops in muscles (flex sensors), all controlled by the neurological system (microprocessor). This hands-on approach showcases how biology can be taught as a series of dynamic feedback systems, encouraging deeper understanding through interactive learning.</p>

                <p>This project involved the construction, testing, and enjoyment of an electric mountain board built from components. It features a 12S4P battery, delivering 120-150W per motor, using a LaCroix 60D+ for power distribution. After bench testing and tuning with VESC, the board was optimized for performance, and it remains in use to this day.</p>
