                <p><strong>Firmware Security Engineer</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Jun 2022 - Present</strong></p>
                <p>At HPE, I focus on maintaining the integrity of Exascale Networking ASICs, contributing to secure high-performance computing environments, as well as providing validation through both simulated and emulated contexts. My work includes improving implementation confidence through extensive software and firmware engineering efforts, such as hardware emulation, CI/CT (continuous integration and testing), and code review. I’ve collaborated with teams across HPE and connected with colleagues from Minnesota, Wisconsin, California, and abroad. Now working full-time as a Firmware Security Engineer, I continue to develop secure and efficient solutions.</p>

                <p><strong>Mar 2022 - Jul 2024</strong></p>
                <p>In the CHOICE Robotics Lab, I contributed to research focused on robotic perception and manipulation, particularly high-occlusion mechanical search. My work extended the Grasping the Invisible (GTI) Pipeline and Image-Oriented Search and Grasp (IOSG). Through my project, AGGRO, I developed a scaled robotic platform, advancing exploration and discovery of the target, and facilitating GTI's singulation and grasping processes. This development included the use of open-source robotic hardware and custom implementations for end-effector and visual integration. The research culminated in my Master's Thesis as part of my Master's in Electronics Engineering.</p>

                <p>My work with Canopy Systems culminated in the MinCorps MVP Challenge, where I collaborated with Aditya, the founder of Canopy, on a sensor fusion project for soil and nutrient monitoring. Through participation in entrepreneurial and technical hackathons, we redefined the real goal behind our sensor technology and gained valuable business insights into the market feasibility of distributed sensors. By showcasing the technology to a broader audience, we learned how our product could fit into the market, helping to shape its development path.</p>

                <p><strong>Sep 2023 - May 2024</strong></p>
                <p>As the project lead for my senior design group, I coordinated efforts to design a solution for a real-world biomedical engineering challenge. Our project involved the creation of a wearable monitoring system to assist individuals with cardiac conditions, integrating elements of human accessibility, power profiles, and communication limitations. We managed our work using GitHub, Altium Designer, and Onshape, utilizing version control to streamline our collaboration. Each team member focused on either hardware or software integrations, and together we successfully delivered a device that was demonstrated live during our presentation and showcase.</p>

                <p><strong>Sep 2021 - Sep 2024</strong></p>
                <p>Throughout my four years with IEEE, I’ve experienced different stages of growth within the organization. As Membership Coordinator during the peak of COVID-19, I focused on student retention and involvement at a time when engagement was at a low. After building relationships within the board and understanding our challenges, I was elected president, where I worked to boost student engagement by increasing company involvement and organizing social events to rebuild a sense of community. As treasurer, I also took on an advisory role, guiding and facilitating projects both financially and with mentorship. This included projects such as modular synthesizers, FPV drones, and various individual efforts. Now, at the international level with IEEE Catalyst, I lead the Student Benefits Webinar, mentoring dozens of chapters across the world.</p>

                <p>As part of the University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project, I contributed to the development of both firmware and hardware solutions for the 14th and 15th vehicle generations, as well as photography and video production throughout the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) and American Solar Challenge 2022. My work involved user-end implementations for the car's infotainment system, along with designing and populating a four-layer PCB in-house using XBee, Bluetooth, and CAN communication for real-time telemetry. We also integrated SD cards and uninterrupted power supply features using supercapacitors to ensure continued operation in the event of a power loss from the low-voltage bus.</p>
